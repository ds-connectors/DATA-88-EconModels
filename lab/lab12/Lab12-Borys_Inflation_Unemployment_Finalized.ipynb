    "* Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising. Another way to look at inflation is the rate at which the purchasing power of currency is falling.\n",
    "* This means that if you hold cash under the matress, that cash becomes less valuable over time (i.e. has less purchasing power) but if you own a house for example, inflation may help increase the value of your house. \n",
    "* If you have loans, you may not want to see a surprise decline in inflation as it means debts are more burdensome. \n",
    "* While Venezuelan-grade inflation is destructive, some inflation in the economy is needed to growth by promoting spending and investing instead of leaving the cash in the matress.\n",
    "* Some inflation is also useful to central banks because it helps them fight recessions. To spur borrowing, they can cut their policy rates to well below the rate of inflation and inflation needs to be above zero to do that.\n",
    "\n",
