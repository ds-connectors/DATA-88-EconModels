    "The [prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) is a classic game first discussed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher in 1950. In this game, there are two prisoners who have been captured and are being interrogated. The prinsoners cannot contact each other in any way. They have two options: they can **defect** (betray the other prisoner to the police) or they can **cooperate** (maintain their silence). If both defect, both receive 4 years in prinson. If one defects and the other does not, the defector goes free and the cooperator receives 5 years in prison. If both cooperate (meaning neither talks to the police), then they each receive 2 years in prison.\n",
