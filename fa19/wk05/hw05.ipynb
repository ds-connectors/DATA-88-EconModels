    "In the lesson, we made a simplification when discussing surplus for the sake of clarity and simplicity. We assigned some willingness to pay (WTP) value to each individual consumer, which never changed once assigned. We then said that an individual's surplus is equal to its WTP minus the market price. This isn't an entirely accurate and general answer to the question of what is surplus, and I chose to simplify the example in this way mainly to produce those clean matrices that resemble the outline of a demand curve. Why is this a simplification? What assumptions have we made to be able to say that an individual's surplus is some fixed WTP minus market price? Your answer can be as long or as short as you want, but please be thorough. This question is an exercise in evaluating what you have learned and checking if an idea generalizes to any scenario.\n",

    "**Question 2.2:** As stated in lesson, this equality between the point-slope formula and the percentage formula doesn't always hold. This is because we change the meaning of $\\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta P}$ in point-slopt form to represent the inverse slope of the curve at the specified point, whereas in the percentage formula, the delta simply represents a change between two points. We were lucky in our example that they yielded the same answer. Describe the shape of a curve where this equality might not always hold."

However, elasticity does not necessarily have to behave this way in all cases. Construct a demand curve that has elasticty of (roughly) 1 at all points on the curve. You may draw the curve and upload it along with your homework PDF onto Gradescope, you may describe the curve in writing, or if you'd prefer, you can use Matplotlib to generate a curve here.

    "In economics, it is important to differentiate time scales. Usually the terms *short run* and *long run* are used to achieve this. What exactly the short run and long run are is a context-specific question. In essence, the short run becomes the long run when certain things that were initially fixed are allowed to change. For instance, the amount of machinery a factory has might be fixed in the short run, due to the cost and inconvenience of installing new machinery, but variable in the long run. While these numbers are made up, one might imagine that on the time scale of one year or less, machinery in a factory is unable to be changed, whereas on the time scale of one year or more, there is enough time to make adjustments to the amount of machinery availble. These time scales vary from context to context, and are rough guesses more than concrete observations."

How significantly, and in what direction, would the quantity of corn produced in this current season by this market change, in comparison to the change in the price of corn?
