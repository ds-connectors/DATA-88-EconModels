What exactly the short run and long run are is a context-specific question. In essence, the short run becomes the long run when certain things that were initially fixed are allowed to change. For instance, the amount of machinery a factory has might be fixed in the short run, due to the cost and inconvenience of installing new machinery, but variable in the long run."
